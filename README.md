# Tiles
Doc with heuristics to tile making.

# Base tiling guides:
Those guides are interchangeable, and they all can be used to fit into classic square textures. 
They also allow independent rotations when combined.
- Linear
- Square
- Triangular

# Derived Tilings:
- Hexagonal (Triangular with removed verts)
- Rectangulars (rhombic, brick, stretched hex, etc.)
